Try to save the world using your deductive skills\!"""

i'll kill the whole world. So, please, pull yourself together :)
I know about your silly mind so i'll give you some clues during our pretty game:
When i say:         That means:
*Pico*          One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
*Fermi*         One digit is correct and in the right position.
*Bagels*        No correct digits in your guess >:c.

The clues will be represented in the alphabet order, so the position of a clue means nothing.
So, lets start the game!"""
